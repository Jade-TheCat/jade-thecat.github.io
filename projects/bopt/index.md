*[BOPT]: Binary Object Protocol for Transport
# Binary Object Protocol for Transport (BOPT)

This is BOPT, a project I have been working on for a few years, between other projects like my site. I previously shared the v1 spec here, but I have removed the link because it did not meet my standards. I will share the v2 spec here when it is ready.

BOPT's licensing is currently unknown, and will be determined on completion of the spec.
